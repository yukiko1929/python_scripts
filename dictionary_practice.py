# # I heard that you married now
# that you find a girl
# and you settle down
# I heard that your dreams come true
# guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
# old friend, why are you so shy
# it ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
# it isn;t over
# nevwe mind I will find someone like you
# I wish nothing but the best for you too
# don't forget me I beg
# I remember you said
# sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
